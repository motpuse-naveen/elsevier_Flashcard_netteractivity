				<b role="heading" aria-level="3">Comment:</b> The thoracic cage is part of the <b>axial skeleton</b>, which also includes the skull and vertebral column. Bones of the thorax include the sternum, the 12 pairs of ribs, and the respective articulations of the ribs. The clavicle and scapula are part of the pectoral girdle, which is associated with the upper limb. 
				<br/><br/>
				Ribs 1-7 articulate with the sternum directly and are called &#x201c;true ribs.&#x201d; Ribs 8-10 articulate to costal cartilages of the ribs above, and are called &#x201c;false ribs.&#x201d; Ribs 11 and 12 articulate only with the vertebrae and are called &#x201c;floating ribs.&#x201d;
				<br/><br/>
				The <b>articulations</b> of the thorax include the sternoclavicular joint (which is a saddle-type synovial joint with an articular disc), the sternocostal joints (which are synchondroses), and the costochondral joints (which are primarily cartilaginous joints).
				<br/><br/>
				The opening at the top of the thoracic cage is the <b>superior thoracic aperture</b>, and the opening at the bottom of the cage is the <b>inferior thoracic aperture</b>, which is closed by the abdominal diaphragm.

				<p id="nomargin"> <b role="heading" aria-level="3">Clinical:</b> Thoracic cage injuries result from trauma and often involve <b>rib fractures</b>. Ribs 1, 11, and 12 are the least fractured ribs. Rib fractures may occur in a transverse plane or an oblique plane or at multiple sites on the same rib, resulting in a free-floating segment (stove-in, or flail chest, injury). The pain is intense because of the continued expansion and contraction of the rib cage necessary during respiration.</p>
